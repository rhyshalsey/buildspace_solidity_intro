# Buildspace solidity intro

This is my project created from the introductory course to Web3 and Solidity on [buildspace.so](https://buildspace.so/).

The course aims to introduce you to the Web3 ecosystem through the Ethereum network using Solidity.

** Disclaimer ** This uses the Ethereum test net and is not written on the real Ethereum blockchain. Otherwise it would cost you real money ðŸ˜‰

## Viewing the project

You can view the deployed project on Vercel here: https://buildspace-solidity-intro-g22ww7ney-rhyshalsey.vercel.app/

### How to use the app

Download and create a Metamask wallet [here](https://metamask.io/download.html). You can then connect it to the app and tell it what your favorite animal is! This will then be recorded on the Ethereum (testnet) blockchain.
